#### KNOW YOURSELF

- Do you want long-term or short-term projects? Some programmers crave change, spending a few months at most on each project. If you like short-term projects and don’t mind traveling, a gig with a consulting company might make more sense than a more conventional corporate job.
- Does management interest you? Some coders have a long-term goal to become a manager, but others shiver at the very thought. If management is your goal, you need to develop lead- ership skills and demonstrate that you can manage the human parts of the software development equation as well as the technical pieces. If management is not your goal, look for companies with good technical career paths, so you’re not forced to manage people to be promoted. (You still need leadership skills to get promoted no matter which career path you choose, but leadership skills are separate from people-management skills.)
- Do you want to work for a big company? Working at big companies has advantages and disadvantages. For example, a large company may offer more job stability (although layoffs during downturns are common) and some kind of career path. It may also have a name brand that nontechies recognize. On the other hand, you may feel stifled by the bureaucracy, rigidness, and intracompany rivalry often found in bigger companies.
- Don’t bother with certifications. The authors of this book believe that programming certificates are of limited value because very few such jobs require certification. Additionally, almost none of the programmers at the top employers have formal programming certificates, and these are the people interviewing/evaluating you. Instead of spending time getting one of the certifications, we suggest working on some of the other recommendations here (side projects, school).
- Recruiters and hiring committees like to see that you have multiple accomplishments—a pattern of getting things done.

#### The Job Application Process

- The first step to getting a job is to find and make contact with companies you’re interested in working for. Although referrals are the best way to land a job, you can also work with headhunters or contact a company directly.
- Small companies
  - One good way to find these companies is to ask friends and acquaintances if they know of startups that are hiring.
  - You can use some sites, such as LinkedIn, to search for people by profession within a region. Most people on these sites list the name of their company, so you can build a list of companies in a particular region by going through the results of this search. This can be laborious, but part of the payoff is that if you can’t find these companies any other way, neither can anyone else, so you’re likely to be competing with fewer applicants.
- Referrals are the best way to find a job. Tell all your friends about what kind of job you’re looking for. Even if they don’t work for the kinds of companies that might hire you, they may know people who do. 
- When you work with headhunters, you must understand their motivation: headhunters are paid only when an applicant they’ve referred is hired. 
- The job description that the headhunter sends you is often copied verbatim from the company’s website, so by pasting it into your favorite search engine you can often find the original job listing.
- Job fairs are an easy way to learn about and make contact with a lot of companies without much effort.
- Several sites exist where you “face-off” against bots and other candidates in coding contests, including TopCoder, HackerRank, and CodeWars. These sites can be an important part of your online profile, and they are also a great source for finding jobs. If you’re successful on these sites, you’ll find job offers coming your way because employers want the best programmers, and this is a convenient way to demonstrate your prowess.
- The company usually takes you out for lunch midway through your interview day. A free lunch at a nice restaurant or even at the company cafeteria is certainly enjoyable, but don’t let your guard down completely. If you make a negative impression at lunch, you may lose your offer. Be polite, and avoid alcohol and messy foods.
- At the end of the day, you may meet with the boss; if the boss spends a lot of time trying to sell you on working for the company, it’s a pretty strong indication that you’ve done well in your interviews and an offer will follow.
- Job applicants traditionally wear suits to interviews. Most tech companies, though, are business casual—or even just casual. The running joke at some of these companies is that the only people who wear suits are job candidates and salespeople.
- After the decision is made to give you an offer, the recruiter’s job is to do everything necessary to get you to accept the offer at the lowest possible salary. 
- Negotiating Your Salary
  - Remember that the best time to get more money is before you accept the job. When you’re an employee, the company holds the power and salary increases are typically much smaller and harder to come by.
- When an offer is made, don’t accept it immediately. Give yourself time to consider it. Look over the offer, and try to negotiate a better deal because most offers aren’t fixed in stone, no matter what the recruiter says. After accepting a job offer, be sure to contact anyone else who has made you an offer to thank them for their interest in you.

#### Phone Screens by Software Engineers

  - For example, it’s not uncom- mon for candidates to claim proficiency in every programming language they’ve ever used, even those used only once for a school assignment.
  - Don’t be surprised or offended by the apparent simplicity of some of the questions. Remember, they’re designed to quickly weed out the exaggerators and liars.

#### Approaches to Programming Problems

  - Coding questions are the heart of the process that most computer and software companies use to decide who to hire. How a candidate performs during the programming interviews is the main determinant of whether an offer is made.
  - The programming questions are generally difficult. If everyone (or even most people) answered a particular question quickly, companies would stop asking it because it wouldn’t tell them anything about the applicants. Many of the questions are designed to take up to an hour to solve, so don’t get frustrated if you don’t see the answer right away. It’s not unusual for each interviewer to explore just a single question.
  - These problems are hard! Some of the questions are designed to see how you handle a problem when you don’t immediately see the solution.
  - Generally, you are asked to write a function or method, but sometimes you need to write a class definition or a sequence of related code modules. In any case, you write code, either in an actual programming language or in some form of pseudocode. (The closer you can get to actual working code, the better.)
  - Interactivity Is Key.
    - Keep talking! Always explain what you are doing. Otherwise, the inter- viewer has no way of knowing how you tackle complex programming problems.
    - Explain what you are doing to your interviewer before and while coding the solution. Keep talking!
    - Make sure you check your code for all error and special cases, especially boundary conditions. 
    - Try an example, and check all error and special cases.
  - One sign that you may be off track is if you find yourself writing too much code. Almost all interview coding questions have short answers. You rarely need to write more than 30 lines of code and almost never more than 50. If you start writing a lot of code, you may be heading in the wrong direction.
  - If asked to comment on the performance of a solution, a Big-O runtime analysis is usually sufficient. Algorithms that run in constant, logarithmic, linear, or quasilinear time are preferred. You should also be prepared to comment on the memory footprint of an algorithm.

#### Linked Lists

  - The simplicity of linked list questions appeals to interviewers who want to present at least two or three problems over the course of a 1-hour interview, because they must give you problems that you can be reasonably expected to solve in only 20 to 30 minutes. You can write a rela- tively complete implementation of a linked list in less than 10 minutes, leaving you plenty of time to solve the problem. In contrast, it might take you most of the interview period to imple- ment a more complex data structure such as a hash table. 
  - When interviewers say “linked list” they generally mean a linear singly linked list.
